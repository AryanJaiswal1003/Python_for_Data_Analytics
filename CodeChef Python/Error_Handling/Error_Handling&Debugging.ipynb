    "   - **Data type mismatches** → Performing operations on incompatible data types.  \n",
    "4. To tackle bugs effectively:  \n",
    "   - Keep your code **organized with comments**.  \n",
    "   - Carefully **read and analyze error messages** for clues.  \n",
    "   - Use debugging methods such as **print statements** or a **debugger tool**.  \n",
