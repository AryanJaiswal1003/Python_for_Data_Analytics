## Project Overview

This project provides a complete framework for performing end-to-end data analysis.  
The main objective is to transform raw data into actionable insights through a standardized and reproducible workflow.  

The methodology emphasizes:
- Adherence to best practices in data handling  
- Analytical rigor  
- Clear documentation for reproducibility

## Key Analytical Libraries

The analysis leverages a set of industry-standard Python libraries, each fulfilling a critical role in the analytical process:

| Library | Primary Function |
|----------|------------------|
| **Pandas** | Efficient data manipulation, structuring data into DataFrame objects, and time series analysis. |
| **NumPy** | Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions. |
| **Matplotlib** | Foundation for creating static, highly customizable plots and visual representations of data. |
| **Seaborn** | High-level interface for attractive and informative statistical graphics (built on Matplotlib). |
| **Jupyter** | Interactive computing environment for live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. |
